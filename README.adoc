== Building and Deploying
This is a Gradle multi-module project. Build it from scratch using:
----
gradle clean build
----

Build it without tests using:
----
gradle build -x test 
----

Build it and copy dependencies into build/libs using:
----
gradle clean build copyDependencies
----

Observations: IntelliJ IDEA still does not know how to handle aspects thus my recommendation to run the examples in the command line is to follow the next steps:

* build the whole project with gradle clean build -x test --refresh-dependencies (from pro-spring-5 directory)
* go to chapter05/aspectj-aspects/
* execute gradle copyDependencies
* go to: aspectj-aspects/build/libs
* execute java -jar aspectj-aspects-5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
